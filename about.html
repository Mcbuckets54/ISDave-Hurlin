                        <p>
                            Serving veterans has been one of the most fulfilling experiences of my life. From a young age, I was inspired by the stories of courage and sacrifice from those who experienced 9/11. This inspiration drove me to seek ways to give back to those who have given so much for our country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My journey began in Kindergarten with volunteering at local cemetary, where I laid flowers on the tombstone of 9/11 victims. Fastforward to 2023, I had the opportunity to intern at a Veteran non-profit called Warrior Rising, a National Veteran organization that hopes to kickstart Veterans' businesses. I help organize fundraisers, and outreach programs in the form of business development. Every pitch meeting that I leave deepens my appreciation for the resilience and strength of these incredible men and women. As stated previously, my primary role is to pitch our business to Fortune 500 firms and second to help organize community events aimed to raise money for Veteran run businesses. At first I thought the goal was to purely think about the Capital Raise, but now that I have pitched a few times the goal is to ultimately raising awareness and fostering a sense of community and respect.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of the most gratifying moments of my life came when I had the opportunity to participate in a national campaign aimed at reducing veteran suicide rates. For a month Warrior Rising partnered with Call Sign 22, a Veteran nonprofit that approaches Veterans in suicidal states. This campaign was a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations and communities. My role was to coordinate with companies, organize awareness events, and connect Equity Investors to Call Sign 22 who helps veterans with the necessary mental health resources. The impact of this campaign was profound; seeing lives changed and knowing our efforts made a difference was humbling.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Working with veterans has taught me invaluable life lessons about service, dedication, and the importance of giving back. It has shaped my personal and professional aspirations, driving me to continue advocating for veterans' rights and well-being. The experiences I've gained have not only enriched my life but also reinforced my commitment to making a positive impact on the lives of others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Looking forward, I am determined to continue my work with veterans. My future plans include developing more comprehensive fund raising event that ensure support programs address the diverse needs of veterans, from mental health to career transition. I am also exploring opportunities to collaborate with larger organizations to amplify the reach and effectiveness of these programs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In conclusion, serving veterans is not just a responsibility but a privilege. Their courage and dedication inspire me every day, and I am honored to play a small part in their journey. I am committed to continuing this mission and making a lasting difference in the lives of those who have served our country. As John F. Kennedy said, "Ask not what the Country can do for you but what you can for your country"
